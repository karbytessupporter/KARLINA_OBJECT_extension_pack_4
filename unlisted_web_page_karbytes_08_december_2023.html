Within the past week karbytes decided to return the (100% petroleum powered) Toyota Matrix car which karbytes was borrowing from its parents back to karbytes' parents (who own that car). That is because karbytes is now certain that the least expensive (in terms of "karmic debt") commute option karbytes could choose is bicycling, walking, taking public transportation, and occasionally renting private transportation or paying for taxi (or Lyft, et cetera) rides.

karbytes was thinking about "karmic debt" with more intensity than usual during the past week. karbytes thinks (or at least finds it useful for karbytes' agenda to imagine) that each person (i.e. the mind of a sufficiently complex information processing agent) technically is immortal and has the potential to be incarnated infinitely many times and/or for at least one of those incarnations to endure for an infinitely long lifespan (and that how long a particular lifespan endures and what circumstances a lifespan originates within is at least partially determined by the cumulative "karmic debt" that mind undergoing the reincarnation has at the time immediately prior to each reincarnation that mind goes through (and, for some of each lifespan, that mind has a "window of opportunity" of "free will" in which to pay off some of that "karmic debt" and/or accrue more "karmic debt" depending on how that mind's chosen actions affect the well-being of that minds' body's encompassing ecosystem)).

<span style="background:#ffff00">According to karbytes, "doing the right thing" (in terms of maximizing ethical "good" and minimizing ethical "bad") means choosing the action (from a set of imagined actions) which accrues the least amount of "karmic debt" (and, the more "karmic debt" there is in existence (at least within one of potentially infinitely many universes), the more suffering there tends to be (throughout the entire respective universe)).</span>

Also according to karbytes, "doing the right thing" does not feel like a loss of <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_06_december_2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intrinsic value</a> to the doer of whatever that action is because the doer feels itself to be benefiting (and not at the expense of some larger encompassing whole comprised of multiple sentient and interdependent parts).

What karbytes is suggesting is that bad health, suffering, and other phenomena associated with a loss of intrinsic value (and with an increase in "karmic debt") is a symptom of not valuing such interdependence and, possibly instead, taking a relatively limited and largely fabricated anthropocentric and speciest worldview which essentially renders most humans as insatiably needy pack rats and breeders who resort to using other sentient creatures as chattel, slaves, food, and torture victims (perhaps for one's own (misguided) <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_4/main/wikipedia_entry_about_schadenfreude_screenshot_30_november_2023.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sadistic pleasure</a>).

karbytes advises readers of this note not to take this note too seriously. It was partially inspired by watching the first half of an interesting documentary karbytes found within the past week on <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Actualized dot Org</a> about some theologian who did copious amounts of <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSD" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LSD</a> and how his experiences with LSD helped him develop his ideas about reincarnation, predetermination, and morality. karbytes remembers being particularly intrigued by hearing commentary in that video about how one of the people who did LSD enough times and/or deeply enough could anticipate that humanity would be going through some tumultuous events before it essentially rebirthes itself into a more evolved version of itself. It made karbytes think that karbytes might indeed have to volunteer to have itself be killed or else simply accept that karbytes' (human) death is almost certain to occur at some point in karbytes' future for the sake of allowing intelligence in general to move forward with its own agenda (using karbytes as a "stepping stone" while karbytes is useful to it and physically available for it to use).
