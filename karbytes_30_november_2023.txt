A single space-time continuum (i.e. mind) cannot render every sequence of phenomena which is ever rendered; but all minds render every sequence of phenomenon ever rendered. 

Do all minds (as a single unified entity) render all imaginable sequences of phenomena?

In other words, do all minds (as a whole rather than as fragments of that whole) render all noumena as phenomena?

Do some information processing agents have more "free will" (i.e. agency) than do other information processing agents?

("Free will" is the hypothetical capacity of a "sufficiently complex" (in terms of modeling the encompassing environment and in terms of interacting with that environment in a goal-oriented manner) information processing agent to be the sole cause of some deterministic chain of events to unfold and to be observed by that information processing agent within the context of that information processing agent's singular (and solipsistic) rendered space-time continuum (as measured by changes in observed information density)).
