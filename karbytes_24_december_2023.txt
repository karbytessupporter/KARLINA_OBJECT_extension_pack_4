Last night (approximately 26 hours ago) I accidentally cut my fingertip on a piece of glass which splintered off from a cannabis oil cartridge which I foolishly decided to break open in order to orally ingest the residual resin on those pieces (due to the fact that the battery for heating that vape cartridge was not charging with the USB-C to USB-C cable I was using to attempt to charge it by plugging it into my laptop's USB-C port (which my portable power stations lack) after I accidentally misplaced my only USB-C to USB 3.0 cable approximately 26 hours ago (and I have since retrieved the misplaced cable and bought two more of such cables)).

It took me longer than it probably should have for me to get around to buying Neosporin (disinfectant for minor skin wounds) and adhesive bandages manufactured especially for helping such wounds heal as quickly as possible while preventing further abrasion to injured area. I was in agony from the cold air blowing against my fingertips as I rode my bicycle to the only store open which I expected would carry any first aid medical supplies: Safeway. 

At this time of writing my finger is now bandaged and the wound has been treated with Neosporin generously applied. 

Also, approximately ten hours ago I purchased two pairs of sweatpants from Walmart (because I had a difficult time staying warm and comfortable only wearing either basketball shorts or else basketball shorts underneath rigid, heavy, unbreathable, and slow drying jeans. It did nor occur to me until very recently (i.e. within the past week) that I could routinely wear something as lightweight, breathable, flexible, and appropriately warm as the synthetic fabric sweatshirts and sweatpants I am wearing now and which I bought within the past week).

In the previous section of this note I accidentally wrote that I cut my finger 26 hours ago (from that time of writing and not this time of writing) instead of 50 hours ago (from that time of writing and not this time of writing).

this : that :: local : remote.

karbytes would like to announce to the general public that karbytes, starting officially "today" (i.e. the day labeled 24_DECEMBER_2023 by karbytes), will update the time stamps (which each denote the approximate time at which karbytes updated a particular section of the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com) which are displayed to the right of each numerically indexed section hyperlink on the home page of the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com if and only if the source code for any web page within the corresponding website section has been updated by karbytes (at approximately the time that section was most recently updated by karbytes).

To be clear, what karbytes implies by the previous paragraph is that karbytes will not update any of those aforementioned time stamps if karbytes only edits the content of a plain-text file or source code file which is (a) located inside of a public karbytes-created GitHub repository and (b) is accessible as a raw file via a hyperlink which is displayed on at least one web page within at least one of karbytes' personal websites (especially the websites named Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com and Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com).

A general rule I have for myself is to make as few edits to web pages (whose domain is either Archive dot Org, WordPress dot Com, or GitHub dot Com) which I classify as being part of the body of digital public domain intellectual property named karbytes (which I go into more detail in defining in the web page named ABOUT_KARBYTES of my personal website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com) as possible and, also, to close each of those aforementioned web hosted files to any further modifications within 24 hours of publishing those files (to publicly accessible and fully WayBack Machine save-able web pages which each have exactly one uniquely corresponding uniform resource locator (i.e. web page address) which can be used to copy the contents of the associated web resource into a new replica web page on the WayBack Machine's public database (at Archive dot Org)).

As a corollary to the previous paragraph, I would like to posit to the general public that, if I do not make any modifications (i.e. adding new files, removing files, or changing the contents of files) to any of the public web hosted files which I refer to as karbytes for more than ten years, then I would advise people to assume that the body of public domain web based intellectual property referred to as karbytes is closed off to further changes forever (with almost zero exceptions).

Finally, I would like to announce that I disapprove of any information processing agent (other than karbytes) making any modifications to the aforementioned body of public domain web based intellectual property referred to as karbytes (except for some hypothetical exceptions). I have always intended for karbytes to be solely managed by its creator: Kar Beringer (i.e. karbytes).
