Last night (approximately 26 hours ago) I accidentally cut my fingertip on a piece of glass which splintered off from a cannabis oil cartridge which I foolishly decided to break open in order to orally ingest the residual resin on those pieces (due to the fact that the battery for heating that vape cartridge was not charging with the USB-C to USB-C cable I was using to attempt to charge it by plugging it into my laptop's USB-C port (which my portable power stations lack) after I accidentally misplaced my only USB-C to USB 3.0 cable approximately 26 hours ago (and I have since retrieved the misplaced cable and bought two more of such cables)).

It took me longer than it probably should have for me to get around to buying Neosporin (disinfectant for minor skin wounds) and adhesive bandages manufactured especially for helping such wounds heal as quickly as possible while preventing further abrasion to injured area. I was in agony from the cold air blowing against my fingertips as I rode my bicycle to the only store open which I expected would carry any first aid medical supplies: Safeway. 

At this time of writing my finger is now bandaged and the wound has been treated with Neosporin generously applied. 

Also, approximately ten hours ago I purchased two pairs of sweatpants from Walmart (because I had a difficult time staying warm and comfortable only wearing either basketball shorts or else basketball shorts underneath rigid, heavy, unbreathable, and slow drying jeans. It did nor occur to me until very recently (i.e. within the past week) that I could routinely wear something as lightweight, breathable flexible, and appropriately warm as the synthetic fabric sweatshirts and sweatpants I am wearing now and which I bought within the past week).

In the previous section of this note I accidentally wrote that I cut my finger 26 hours ago (from that time of writing and not this time of writing) instead of 50 hours ago (from that time of writing and not this time of writing).

this : that :: local : remote.
