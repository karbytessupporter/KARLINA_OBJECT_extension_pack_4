<p><span style="background:#ffff00">This web page exists in order to prevent the uniform resource locator named A from being saved &#8220;too many times&#8221; as a result of karbytes saving the the uniform resource named B to the WayBack Machine using the WayBack Machine&#8217;s &#8220;save outlinks&#8221; feature, karbytes created this web page. (Originally, karbytes was going to use the uniform resource locator represented by A instead of the uniform resource locator represented by C on the web page located at the web address represented by B). The creator (i.e. Alan Jason Ponte) of the website located at the web address represented by A is a former colleague of karbytes during the time karbytes worked as an Information Technology Help Desk student intern at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory from 01_JUNE_2012 to 30_SEPTEMBER_2015. </span></p>
