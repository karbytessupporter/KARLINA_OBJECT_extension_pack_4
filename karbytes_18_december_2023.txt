In the image named karlina_object_updated_17_december_2023_pdf_print.jpg  (which was uploaded to the public karbytes-created GitHub repository named KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_4), a paper print-out of the files named consciousness_17_december_2023_abridged.pdf and karlina_object_dot_wordpress_dot_com_home_page_17_december_2023.pdf (which were both added to the aforementioned GitHub repository yesterday) is displayed inside of a project portfolio three-ring binder folder with clear sheet protectors and sheets arranged in their intended orders (and in the file order listed by this paragraph). 

That portfolio folder has been added to the storage bin in karbytes' room which contains all other PDF print-outs and M-DISC backups of karbytes-created karbytes intellectual property (especially the intellectual property featured in the web page named KARLINA_OBJECT_winter_2023_starter_pack_physical_artifacts_inventory of the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com)).

Note that every PDF file which karbytes has both created and uploaded on a public karbytes-created GitHub repository has been printed out onto sheets of paper (as described by the text in those documents) at least one time. Therefore, at least one time in karbytes' memorized traversal along exactly one space-time continuum, each PDF file which karbytes has both created and uploaded on a public karbytes-created GitHub repository has been instantiated in physical form (relative to karbytes' perspective). From an all-encompassing multiverse's perspective (if such a multiverse exists), there always exist physical print-outs which karbytes created of each PDF file which karbytes has created and which karbytes has uploaded to a public karbytes-created GitHub repository.
