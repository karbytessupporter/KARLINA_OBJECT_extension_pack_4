<span style="background:#ffff00;color:#000000">This note is a continuation of what was discussed on the following karbytes-created web page:</span>

<a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_27_december_2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_27_december_2023/</a>

While assessing whether or not I could currently afford to leave some of the items which I have been carrying in my backpack at home (in order to make more room to fit the stuff which is already bulging out the top of the backpack), I had the thought that <u>I am my websites' motor functionality (and its executive processing center in general)</u> which is related to the thought I am having as I write this note on my phone that, without me (i.e. the <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">information processing agent</a> named karbytes), those websites (which are (a) the website named <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com</a> and (b) the website named <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com</a>) would (as presumed by karbytes) remain unchanged for as long as the physical media which preserve the digital files which constitute all the media and source code of those two websites remain in tact (such that those files are accessible to the general public in the format of software objects displayed in a web browser or operating system on some computational hardware device and such that each of those media files and executable source code files are hosted on a web server as public domain intellectual property).

I want to be clear to the general public that those two websites and the brand of public domain intellectual property referred to as karbytes (by the information processing agent named karbytes which wrote that intellectual property) which those websites are part of is intended by their author to always remain solely modified by karbytes. 

To be clear, <u>only karbytes is authorized to make edits to any of those (karbytes-created GitHub dot Com hosted or else karbytes-created WordPress dot Com hosted) files, to delete any of those files, or to create additional files to add to that collection of (public domain based) digital files referred to as karbytes</u> (according to the terms expressed in (a) the web page named <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/about_karbytes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ABOUT_KARBYTES</a> and (b) the web page named <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_code_continues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KARBYTES_CODE_CONTINUES</a> on the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com (and (c) the web page named <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/public_domain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PUBLIC_DOMAIN</a> on the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com)).
