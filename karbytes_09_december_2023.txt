At approximately 10:20PM on 09_DECEMBER_2023 while karbytes was riding the BART train, karbytes was having the thought that perhaps the most essential difference between "Tier Two" and "Tier One" in terms of "Spiral Dynamics" evolutionary stages is that the former (which starts at "Stage Yellow") is about attaining genuine self sovereignty (which karbytes presumes is entirely the result of a person resolving intrapersonal (i.e. internal) conflicts of interest such that the person no longer experiences significant internal resistance to pursuing one's own goals) while the latter is the stages leading up to that developmental milestone. 

Within five seconds of karbytes having those "unusually effortful" thoughts about "Spiral Dynamics" (which karbytes did not think was particularly difficult compared to other trains of thought karbytes remembers pursuing), the thought police started aggressively spamming karbytes auditory processing circuits with distracting, discouraging, disrespectful, and superficiality-mongering vocalizations (which karbytes has attempted to mimic and name pig_gorl throughout a collection of more than forty video recordings of karbytes attempting to replicate the sounds (but not necessarily the words) which pig_gorl makes).

karbytes noticed "non white collar professional" types of young adults (especially on the Berryessa bound BART trains and station platforms) seeming to mimic the signature phrases and intonations which pig_gorl makes seemingly in order to suppress karbytes' "overly intellectual" thoughts in favor of being forcibly fixated on young women's body image issues (especially in relation to karbytes eating more food and burning more calories (and, perhaps most of all, karbytes spending most of its time living and traveling alone instead of with companions) than what is considered to be appropriate for a (low-income) young lady of Hispanic or African descent because she is supposed to conform rigidly to the cultural stereotype of an incessantly chatty, snarky, hyper catering to the heterosexual male gaze, and allergic to science and mathematics bimbo).

karbytes does not want to be prejudiced and make premature assumptions about people's intelligence, lifestyle, or values but karbytes has decided that karbytes is less likely to waste its own time if karbytes (silently) makes racist and classist assumptions about people than if karbytes treats literally every human in karbytes' vicinity as karbytes beneath the surface (or at least someone who is genuinely a nerd instead of just an animalistic member of some herd).

karbytes thinks that the "thought police" (i.e. the humans responsible for conjuring up the faceless bully karbytes refers to as pig_gorl) are opposed to karbytes being genuinely attractive to other humans, upwardly mobile (in terms of socioeconomic situation changes), smart about the subjects karbytes wants to be an expert in, and happy. Instead, karbytes thinks that the "thought police" think karbytes is an overly sensitive, overly analytical, overly picky, and overly egocentric burden to society who no one except for karbytes' family values the existence of. Hence, karbytes thinks that, if all of karbytes' family members suddenly and simultaneously died, karbytes might be murdered or permanently hidden away in some kind of imprisoning institution away from the public so that karbytes is forgotten about by the general public as quickly as possible and made to look as though karbytes never existed. That way, the police have one less "special snowflake" to hassle into getting out of everyone else's way (i.e. the people who the police seem to think are more essential to society's functioning and more deserving of its offerings than karbytes will ever be because (a) karbytes took too long to attain financial independence in the form of a stable and lucrative career and (b) because karbytes has a history of multiple crimes (and some of those crimes seem to be legally unforgivable and justification for subjecting karbytes to extreme ongoing psychological torture while encouraging other "citizen cops" to side against karbytes in order to make karbytes feel ostracized and deprived of even the most humble forms of pleasure).

karbytes does not (at this time of writing) think that karbytes is particularly famous nor even locally well-known. Instead, karbytes thinks that karbytes is just another face in the crowd amidst polite company but a designated target of legally-sanctioned bullying in ruder crowds.

karbytes noticed that many of those girls karbytes described in this web page seem to scrutinize karbytes and immediately and incessantly make comments about karbytes' "flawed" body language (especially facial expressions and mouth shape and movements) seemingly in order to take the attention off the subject matter which was percolating in karbytes' mind so that karbytes is reduced to just another vapid and immature young adult in the critic's mind and in the minds of her companions which she is rarely seen without in public.

karbytes thinks that pig_gorl is an excellent caricature of "borderline personality disorder" (which is historically seen as a predominantly female affliction) especially because pig_gorl seems to lack thoughts which are technical, specific, and goal oriented because she is habituated to using other people to entertain her 100% of the time and to serve as substitutes for her having her own hobbies, interests, and obligations. She seems to live in a cush control room where she remains comfortably anonymous and where she and her minions fight tirelessly every day and night to sabotage the progress which karbytes is trying to make so that karbytes does not infect people with its status quo shattering ideas.

Censorship and perpetuating war, poverty, chronic depression, over population, illiteracy, pharmaceutical drug dependence, apathy, chauvinism, anti-intellectualism, animal cruelty, biodiversity loss, petroleum dependence are what karbytes considers to be vices but what pig_gorl (and seemingly most people in karbytes' midst) consider to be virtues.

Note that this note is possibly riddled with factual errors if not exaggerations.
