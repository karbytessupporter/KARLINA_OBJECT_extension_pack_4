I was thinking about the universal basic income ideas which I wrote about more than six months ago in the following web pages which I wrote:

I would like to propose a revised high-level model of what I think would make for an ideal economy:

KARBYTES_ECONOMY_MODEL:

Let MONTH_TOKEN be the name of the basic irreducible unit of monetary value which a civilization's economy uses for representing some arbitrary and relatively fixed number of kilowatts of energy or United States dollars (and such that each MONTH_TOKEN which that civilization instantiates is set to expire at midnight on the first day of the month which occurs immediately after the month in which that particular MONTH_TOKEN was instantiated (and that MONTH_TOKEN is entirely a software object which is relegated solely to the World Wide Web and was instantiated at midnight on the first day of a month)).

On the first day of each month at midnight, the technocratic socialist democratic government deposits a relatively fixed and relatively universal (natural) number of MONTH_TOKEN instances into each MONTH_TOKEN user account such that each adult member of the respective government has a fairly predictable and optimized amount of (expirable) "money" to spend each month.

The range deemed to be most optimal for selecting a universal basic income monthly average (in units of MONTH_TOKEN) by karbytes is (a) no fewer MONTH_TOKEN instances than what is necessary to pay for "basic expenses" such as food, rent, clothes, household items, electronics, medical coverage, and transportation and (b) no more MONTH_TOKEN instances than what what would enable a disruptively lopsided distribution of economic resources throughout the respective civilization.

Citizens within such a civilization are strongly encouraged to attend university and/or participate in the human work force in order to foster optimal individual and societal well-being (i.e. long term survival, self esteem, and a sense of interdependence on a metaphysical and ecological level) while as many jobs as possible (which humans are not "in demand" for performing) are outsourced to robots.

<span style="background:#ffff00">I would like to add to this web page that, also, citizens may earn "bonus" MONTH_TOKEN instances (which are government-generated and issued to employers and individuals (based on merit or on having "special needs")) from working at jobs, partaking in contests or community events, or from self-employed means of generating income such as selling merchandise or access to proprietary information online. <strong><u>Note that each individual (i.e. for exactly one person) user account of MONTH_TOKEN cannot store more than a universal upper limit (for all MONTH_TOKEN users in a respective civilization) and that "overflow" tokens will be immediately returned to sender of tokens.</u></strong></span>
