// karbytes fancies itself to be an egoist rather than an egotist (at the "core" of what karbytes actually is and not merely at some "fade layer" encompassing and being projected from that "core" (which karbytes visualized to be some hole inside of some phenomenal mesh which travels through that mesh much the way an electrical charge (measured as some quantity of voltage) travels along a linear path comprised of adjacent electron clouds (such that the "voltage" is a traveling gap between adjacent electron clouds)).

// facade : electron :: core : voltage. 

// facade : voltage :: core : electron.

// Do not get too "carried away" with this potentially absurdist musings about physical reality. It may or may not be an accurate depiction of electricity and of metaphysical phenomena (if any exist).
