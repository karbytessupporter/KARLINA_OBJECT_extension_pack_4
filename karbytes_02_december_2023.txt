On 02_DECEMBER_2023 karbytes burned three M_DISCs with most recent versions of each of the five zip files containing the entire contents of their respective karbytes-created GitHub repositories, tested each of those M_DISCs to ensure that the aforementioned files were burned to that disc, and placed each of those discs (inside of its original jewel-case container) inside of the same Amazon envelope which that set of three M_DISCs was delivered inside of (and then added some cushioning to that envelope in the form of puffed wheat cereal). That stuffed envelope was placed inside the same metal box which contains the other two containers which each contain exactly three M_DISCs and such that each one of those sets of three M_DISCs has encoded on each one of its respective three discs the same collection of digital files).

Also on 02_DECEMBER_2023, karbytes printed out a paper copy of the digital file named causality_winter_2023_abridged.pdf, put each page of that document inside of a plastic sheet protector, and placed those pages inside of sheet protectors (in chronological order) inside of one of the two green three-ring binders inside of the same gray plastic storage bin which contains the metal box containing each of the aforementioned M_DISCs.

At approximately 9:46PM Pacific Standard Time on 02_DECEMBER_2023, karbytes added the passage comprised of the previous two paragraphs of this plain-text note to the web page named KARLINA_OBJECT_winter_2023_starter_pack_physical_artifacts_inventory of the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com (and that web page is assumed by karbytes to be in its final draft form).
