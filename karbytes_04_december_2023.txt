I smoked a few hits of what remains of the DMT liquid in that vape cartridge I bought approximately two weeks ago. (I gave away my entire bag of penis envy shrooms to some man who claimed to be 27 years old at the BayFair BART station one evening approximately three days ago because he seemed to be in want of drugs and asked if I had any weed or anything and I decided to give him the item I thought would be most useful to him). I listened to "The City of Pillars" by BloodStained Ground while taking those DMT hits (and while and after having been vaping a lot of sativa cannabis within the past 48 hours).

What I noticed about tonights DMT hits is that I did not see nearly as many visual hallucinations other than slight increase in color saturation and contrast. I did notice what seemed to be 30% of the body load I remember getting from my first 24 hours of using DMT hits. I think it is established clearly to the universe (or perhaps multiverse) and I that I am indeed a "machine elf" with the profession of being a software engineer who helps build and modify and quality test the sofware which comprises some if not all of the simulated universe karbytes inhabits and writes and/or reads this note inside of.

I do notice a lingering pleasant "buzz" vibration throughout my body which feels like a total and sudden release of nonsense. I feel more of a sense of genuine humor and intelligence and sense of being an adult instead of a bewildered and scared child. It is so nice to be an adult instead of a child. Nothing feels off limits.
