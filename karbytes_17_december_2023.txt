I wrote the previous section of this note after mentally drafting it while riding the midnight BART train from Dublin/Pleasanton to Fremont.

I wrote it for the purpose of reminding myself (in as few words as possible) how to take care of myself so that I maximize my longevity and enjoyment of living.

While bicycling from the BART station to the marsh (near the warehouse complex where I work as a package sorter at), I thought about copy-pasting the main content of the most recent journal entry (i.e. the web page named karbytes_16_december_2023 on the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com) which I have written and shared on my social media profiles into a new web page on the website named Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com named CONSCIOUSNESS.
