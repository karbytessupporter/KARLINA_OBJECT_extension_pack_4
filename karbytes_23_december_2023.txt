I am the fastest sperm.

Technically, every human adult originally starts as a female more than a male due to the fact that the egg comprises more than half the total mass of the zygote.

(A zygote is an egg which is fertilized by exactly one sperm (though bioengineering can produce zygotes whose genome is derived from more than two parent genomes)).

Perhaps other factors besides speed are what cause an egg and sperm to fuse in order to produce a zygote. Perhaps the egg implements a selection process (with built-in (if not learned) rudimentary preferences). 

This is an attempt to document consciousness as it emerges from "lower" or "nonexistent" levels of itself.

This is poetry.
