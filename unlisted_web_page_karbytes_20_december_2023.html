<span style="background:#ffff00">I have one request for Christmas 2023 and for my 34th birthday on 13_JANUARY_2024: for at least one person (especially a person who has never donated money to me before) to donate approximately five dollars to my website via the PayPal donation link on the home page of <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com</a> (which is also displayed on the home page of <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com</a>).</span>

Such donations are useful to me as empirical evidence that my websites are not being censored on the public World Wide Web. 

(A strategy which I have been using throughout the entire time in which my websites have been under development is pretending that neither my websites nor my social media profiles are being censored from the public World Wide Web because doing so causes me to allocate cognitive resources in ways which I think are more conducive to making progress towards my personal goals (which encompass more "expensive" processes than merely surviving as cheaply and comfortably as possible) than assuming that such content is being censored from being found by members of the general public on the (surface-level) World Wide Web. If I assumed that only I, the police, and maybe a few other people were ever allowed to access my social media profiles and my personal websites while everyone else is unable to access that content if they visited the web pages in which that content is displayed, then I would not enjoy the process of developing and exploring my websites as much as I currently do because a significant part of what makes such an enterprise enjoyable for me is anticipating that other people will eventually discover my content and benefit from it and perhaps even connect with me via social media where they can share their own content of interest for me and others to discover. I would not want to limit such networking to only those who act as gatekeepers to the resources I want access to because, if I did, my networking experience would be too much like a jail and not enough of a hub for legitimate global commerce and information exchange).

<span style="background:#00ff00">If you are not comfortable making a monetary donation to me using the PayPal donation link on my websites' home pages (or if you are otherwise physically unable to send money to me via the PayPal donation link on my personal websites), I urge you to comment on the social media post which may have lead you to this web page or by sending me a comment in the form of an email message to karlinaberinger99@gmail.com. What I want you to do is tell me you found this web page and read it. I would also appreciate you telling me some details about yourself such as where you live, what you do for a living, what your interests are, what your main goals in life are, and any other information you want to share with me. You are welcome to send me any content you want to; questions and criticism included. I may or may not reply to all incoming messages I receive but there is a probability greater than zero percent that I will.</span>

Based on the behavior I have observed of many humans in physical proximity to me especially but also humans in cyberspace, I suspect that many humans feel compelled to pretend not to notice my existence (which is understandable to me because each human only has a finite amount of cognitive resources to expend per finite time period) or else to actively attempt to sabotage my attempts to experience satisfaction for intrinsic rather than purely extrinsic reasons. In pertaining to the latter, I suspect that there exist many humans who condone that I be bullied in ways which are not likely to be retaliated against nor prevented from occurring and also that I be prevented from getting information I need in order to feel that my web presence is not being censored from the public World Wide Web. Within the past week at least three human individuals have already forcibly attempted to talk to me face-to-face but proceeded to interrupt me with ad hominem insults as soon as I started talking. I stopped while they (usually a man) got the last word in that "conversation". I figured that what that person was doing was telling me to act like I cannot come up with intelligible verbal thoughts while he can. I figured that is a good microcosm of what is happening on a larger systemic level within human civilization. 

The vast majority of humans seem too impoverished to do much other than try to sabotage whoever they see as their competitors. What makes me seem "not poor" instead of "appropriately poor" (like those guys are) is me preferring to invest my cognitive resources in bettering my living situation and in pursuing my hobbies instead of in waging war on whoever my competitors or enemies are (and, in order for me to exist, so do they apparently because there is apparently always more animals in a (primitive (i.e. non-veganized and non-sexual-reproductionized)) ecosystem than there are resources available to enable all of those animals to survive for indefinitely long time periods). Hence, I my strategy has been and likely will continue to be treating humans by default as people who hardly tolerate my existence and who would beat me up and kill me if they knew they could do so without them having to experience consequences which would be sufficiently unpleasant to them (which means I likely will see zero donations and zero emails from other humans which pertain to the text displayed on this web page in particular). 

I have heard some humans rather passive aggressively and usually with a dog or human accompanying them say to me while walking by that I deserve to be ignored and even what I would call mistreated until and unless I make more human friends and spend more of my cognitive resources on interpersonal relationships with such friends. Perhaps the purpose of the forced auditory propaganda and controlling behaviors many other humans have shown towards me is to torture me into finding an escape from such bullying in the form of passive media consumption, hanging out with (low achieving) humans, and generally abstaining from doing anything "too ego intensive" such as building a calculus problem solving web application or assembling a highly compact and effective outdoor recreation kit whose parts are not all sold at Walmart. Hell, even getting something to eat every day which I take pleasure in eating is enough to trigger some people into acting outraged (and loudly and incessantly so in the form of some tenor mooing trying to instigate a fight with me). I see many "low brow" apes passive aggressively smoking cigarettes in places they expect me to be confined to for longer than 60 seconds as though to insinuate non ambiguously that they are opposed to karbytes being healthy and happy because such people think karbytes is a parasite to be gotten rid of or at least seriously disenfranchised.

I am not interested in befriending humans nor even in having any sexual relations with them until and unless I feel that I options which are sufficiently attractive to me rather than non-options which practically rape me into submitting to their whims. 

On the same vein, I would like to suggest that, if every human adult (emancipated minor) was issued a universal basic income sufficient to pay for basic living expenses, the humans who already have high-paying and highly-skilled jobs would want to continue working at those jobs instead of quitting those in order to live off the savings they accumulated and the basic income the government gives them because such jobs are a source of self esteem and professional community amongst people with similar interests. 

Those who are afraid of everyone being allowed to live on an unconditional basic income sufficient to pay for basic necessities probably think humans would settle for being overly incestuous or isolationist or lazy or uneducated or severely mentally ill unless those humans are forced to regularly congregate in employment centers in order to receive any money at all. 

A lot of people seem upset with me solely because I appear to have what those people think is simultaneously "too much" money and "too much" free time (and I only seem to have exactly as much of both as I need to have at any given time in order to make what I think is at least minimally adequate progress towards my goals (and I am not at all opposed to getting more money but I am always apprehensive about "selling" my free time in exchange for something I value)).

<span style="background:#ffff00">The biggest glaring problem I currently see with humanity is its stubbornly habitual and voracious fossil fuels mining and combustion. As I watch hundreds of automobiles being driven by monkeys from the vantage of a freeway overpass, I also cannot help but wish that all of those cars are fully electric with robot driving override and self driving features. If that were the case, the air I breathe would be significantly cleaner and there would be significantly fewer vehicle collisions. The general public seemingly would rather pay attention to sex and violence scandals as a form of escapist entertainment than pay attention to news and information pertaining to environmental sustainability, automation on a revolutionary scale, and cultured biological tissues. My websites are meant to be eternally available for any information processing agent to behold, but my most favored audience are probably people who are at least somewhat obsessed with the topics of environmental sustainability, automation on a revolutionary scale, and cultured biological tissues.</span>
