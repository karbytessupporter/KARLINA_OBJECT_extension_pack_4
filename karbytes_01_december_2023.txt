On 30_NOVEMBER_2023 at approximately 8PM, the WayBack Machine (which is part of the website named Archive dot Org) started to generate the following server response (Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) code 404) to each Uniform Resource Locator (URL) which karbytes input into the WayBack Machine web page capture form:

---

Not Found

The requested URL was not found on the server. If you entered the URL manually please check your spelling and try again.

karbytes reports having occasionally experienced various types of WayBack Machine service outages during the past four years and that most of those service outages lasted for no more than 24 hours.

karbytes thinks that most of those service outages (including the service outage specifically referred to by this journal entry) is most likely entirely the result of routine server maintenance (especially since the aforementioned service outage occurred on the last day of the month (possibly because WayBack Machine web page capture requests need to be rejected in order to prevent those web page saves from being improperly indexed in the WayBack Machine database according to each of those saves' calendar date).

karbytes has been reluctant to publicly disclose specific personally identifying details about interpersonal conflicts which recently occurred in karbytes' life and which karbytes did not initiate in the "chapter" of karbytes' blog named KARLINA_OBJECT_EXTENSION_PACK_4. 

karbytes has also been reluctant to refer to itself using first person pronouns (such as "I", "me", and "mine") in KARLINA_OBJECT_EXTENSION_PACK_4.

The previous two paragraphs of this plain-text journal entry are meant by karbytes to insinuate that karbytes is being stricter in this chapter than in previous chapters in terms of informational content which karbytes permits to take residence in karbytes' blog.

The previous three paragraphs of this note are related to the fact that karbytes suspects that law enforcement personnel or other persons have hacked into karbytes' laptop computer and smartphone in order to block or redirect karbytes' Internet traffic in order to censor karbytes' intellectual property publication attempts (perhaps because karbytes' blogging content (which is entirely encapsulated (in the form of web pages and outgoing hyperlinks) by the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com) contains what some people deem to be controversial or inconvenient subject matter or because some people think karbytes deserves to be subject to adversity in order to satisfy some people's cravings for schadenfreude specifically at karbytes' expense).

karbytes has posited that the "worst case scenario" pertaining to the context of the WayBack Machine web page save (or web page save retrieval) requests (to the servers which run the WayBack Machine) is (a) karbytes being prevented from successfully saving web pages to the WayBack Machine ever again and (b) web page saves (or media files which are embedded in those saved web pages) being permanently removed from the WayBack Machine database.

If the aforementioned "worst case scenario" occurs, karbytes will likely update each of the "micro directory" web pages which are referenced via hyperlink in the web page named RAW_GITHUB_FILES_MACRO_DIRECTORY of the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com by striking out (putting a line through a sequence of text characters without making that text unreadable) the paragraphs which describe karbytes' WayBack Machine batch web page save procedure and, above those paragraphs, add a paragraph which announces that karbytes is no longer able to successfully save its website content to the WayBack Machine database (but karbytes will likely find some alternative service for publicly archiving web hosted digital files and allude to that service in that newly appended paragraph).

On 01_DECEMBER_2023 at approximately 1AM, karbytes is still receiving the same WayBack Machine error as described in the previous section of this note.

Without going into explicit detail, karbytes has recently (i.e. within the past three hours of appending this section to this note) come to the conclusion that law enforcement is trying to train karbytes to think, feel, and act more humble and far less entitled to what karbytes wants more of such that karbytes is practically invisible on the public World Wide Web and throughout most of human civilization and while being extremely undemanding of other humans (such that karbytes is practically an undercover Buddhist monk disguised as some kind of poor working class American who is not allowed to truly relax nor be as ambitious as karbytes really wants to be so that (a) the police and other humans have karbytes available to derive sadistic amusement from cornering and torturing and (b) so that karbytes is physically coerced into doing slave labor which is detrimental to karbytes' goals while being entirely in service to other people's goals).

karbytes thinks that other people want karbytes to hurry up and disappear so that "more worthy" humans take up resources which otherwise would be allocated to karbytes implementing karbytes' agenda. (That does not necessarily mean that karbytes thinks people other than karbytes want karbytes to commit suicide, but karbytes is convinced that many humans strongly prefer karbytes to be incarcerated in a psychiatric hospital or prison for several decades if not for the remainder of karbytes' lifespan).

To elaborate on the previous two paragraphs, karbytes thinks that many humans prefer that karbytes stop exercising, eating healthily, and doing other habitual activities which prolong karbytes' lifespan and physical and mental faculties beyond what is considered to be normal for an aging poor working class American who never attended college and who lives a mostly sedentary lifestyle while subsisting on copious amounts of red meat, alcohol, and cigarettes. karbytes' rationale for making such a claim is that karbytes thinks that most other humans in karbytes' society think karbytes only deserves to be as only as able bodied as necessary to survive below the poverty line entirely for other people's convenience (which effectively demotes karbytes from being a self-sovereign person to a subhuman utility whose sole value is the price tag other humans assign to karbytes as that utility). karbytes also thinks many people think karbytes should be more willing to humor and placate other humans while not showing them any self concern other than what pertains to those other people's convenience and comfort (to the exclusion of karbytes' own convenience and comfort). karbytes says that karbytes is only "willing" to do that if tortured and physically coerced into doing so (and until that happens karbytes is essentially "boycotting" socializing with other humans more than the absolute bare minimum required for karbytes to obtain and keep a job and lifestyle which is adequately acceptable to karbytes.

Finally (in this section of this note and in relation to the topic of "worst case scenarios" (which was broached in the previous section of this note)), karbytes posits that, if karbytes were to become severely physically, mentally, or legally disabled, karbytes would be left in the custody of people who covertly (if not overtly) take sadistic pleasure in karbytes' demise and misery and who would be enabled by their encompassing community to deprive karbytes of resources and opportunities which karbytes wants but which are decided by the community to be unnecessary such that karbytes is effectively left to rot inside of a prison instead of being able to undergo some kind of rehabilitation and occupational therapy which would boost karbytes' self esteem and sense of autonomy despite having lost major functionality and freedoms following the "crippling" incident. 

As a corollary to the previous paragraph, karbytes thinks that perhaps the most stable and worthwhile investment karbytes could make is delving into as much psychedelics and contemplation and empirical investigation of reality as possible for the sake of, as rapidly as possible (and before karbytes is prevented from partaking in such endeavors by some horrifically "crippling" situation), developing a deep sense of wisdom, appreciation, humor, and resilience which would enable karbytes to possibly thrive even in the most dire of circumstances.

On 01_DECEMBER_2023 at approximately 10AM, karbytes was able to successfully save URLs to the WayBack Machine. In other words, at the time this section of this note was appended to this note, the WayBack Machine appears to be working normally for karbytes.

I think that it is somewhat likely that, sometime while I use DMT after orally ingesting some specially prepared form of it (i.e. like what shamans have used for religious ceremonies), I might (based on what I have personally read on the internet) temporally (within the span of 24 hours) dream that I am some creature other than karbytes and possibly forget that I am karbytes.

(Yes I know that I am using first person pronouns such as "I", "me", and "my" instead of third person pronouns such as "it" and "its" (and my self assigned primary name (which is, of course, karbytes). That is because the details in this section of this note are easier for me to articulate from a personal (i.e. "warm" and "intimate") perspective instead of from a relatively impersonal (i.e. "cold" and "detached" and "alien") perspective).

While I experience that DMT induced dream state described in the second to most recent paragraph before this paragraph, it is (at least hypothetically) possible that I (i.e. karbytes) will literally teleport from being physically localized and confined to the human body which consumed that DMT drink to some other parallel (but just as physically real) universe in which I may or may not be localized and confined to some human body which resembles karbytes.

In other words, consuming a sufficiently powerful psychedelic might actually physically cause my body to die while my continuity of consciousness "travels" (i.e. "teleports") into a new universe which appears to be very similar if not identical to the universe my body died in. 

(If that is true (and I am doubtful it is), then using sufficiently powerful psychedelics is literally a means for extending my lifespan indefinitely because, as soon as the body I am currently inhabiting becomes too inhospitable to ("my") consciousness to want to inhabit , then I could either take a sufficiently strong psychedelic (which I strongly prefer) or else allow my body to physically die (which I do not prefer) as a means to facilitate my next reincarnation cycle).
normally for karbytes.

This morning (and every Friday which I work at the Amazon facility in Fremont, California), my paycheck (whose amount is a function of the number of hours I worked for that week) gets directly deposited into my Patelco checking account. I decided to save at least $100 of my most recently deposited paycheck so that I can afford to quickly obtain a new (Android operating system) phone from the nearby Target (or some other relatively local "brick and mortar" store) because my phone is perhaps my most essential tool. It functions as an alarm clock, means to select shifts at Amazon, make and receive phone calls, text messages, and email messages, browse the World Wide Web, make (quick and simple) edits to my blog (i.e. updating plain-text journal files which are hosted in a karbytes-created public (or private) GitHub repository, and use a loud alarm clock application to wake me up from sleeping at predetermined times which I specify so that I am not late to my appointments.
