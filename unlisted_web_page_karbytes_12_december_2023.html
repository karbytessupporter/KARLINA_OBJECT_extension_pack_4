Yesterday (i.e. the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gregorian calendar</a> day labeled 11_DECEMBER_2023) I did not make any edits to my <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WordPress dot Com</a> websites nor to my <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social media</a> profiles nor to my public <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a> repositories. I was tentatively planning on taking a hiatus from making such updates (except for the file named <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_4/main/karbytes_testosterone_updates.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">karbytes_testosterone_updates.txt</a> in the GitHub repository named <a style="background: #00ff00;color: #000000" href="https://github.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_4</a>) for a period of time lasting between one day and two months so that I could focus on my own research and development projects which may be a bit time consuming and messy to complete to my satisfaction and which I would not want to show off to the public until those projects are complete to my satisfaction. 

Today (i.e. the Gregorian calendar day labeled 12_DECEMBER_2023) I decided to end that hiatus a bit early in order to add this note file (i.e. the plain-text file named <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_4/main/karbytes_12_december_2023.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">karbytes_12_december_2023.txt</a>) to the GitHub repository named KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_4 in addition to some other files (particularly source code and media files pertaining to new software applications which I intend to include in my primary website (i.e. the website named <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com</a>) as tutorial documentation web pages whose hyperlinks are highlighted black with green text on the home page of that website).

Note that the code files may not be in their final draft form for at least three weeks starting at the time I add those files to my public GitHub repositories (but I do not expect those files' respective software applications and tutorial web pages to take me longer than six months to complete). Regardless of whether or not those files are in their final draft form I intend to save them to the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayback_Machine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WayBack Machine</a> regularly (especially immediately after I make updates to those files).

<span style="background:#ffff00">As soon as I can feasibly afford a <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_mask" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gas mask</a> which (do I need breathable air tanks(?)) filters out at least 95% of all the toxic chemicals in the air as a result of <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fossil fuels</a> combustion and other human-caused pollution, I will order one from the Internet and wear it religiously while <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bicycling</a> and riding the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BART</a> trains in order to (a) protect myself from harmful pollution and (b) spread awareness of the severity of human-caused environmental damage (which is especially harmful to humans).</span>
