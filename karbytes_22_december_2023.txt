I hypothesis that it is possible for humans to create a software simulation which appears to humans to be a scaled-down (yet sampled thoroughly enough to appear to encompass every law of physics, mathematics, and symbolic logic in general) model of the (relatively) physical universe which encompasses that software simulation and such that the software simulation contains within it a functional virtual replica of the physical computer running that software (and each successive "layer" of virtual reality which is being simulated on the original physical computer is a "lossy" digital approximation of that layer's parent layer for some finite number of layers until some "base case" to that recursive modeling process is obtained (and I assume that such a base case is where the data is too incomplete or too corrupted to render a functional virtual universe (i.e. a universe which is capable of modeling functional computational hardware running functional software)).

(I originally started typing this note when I thought that there could be indefinitely many virtual reality layers inside of one computer simulation using the argument that all phenomena are fundamentally confined to and consisting of cyberspace (i.e. software simulated realities)).

(I would define a phenomenon as some spatially and temporally finite collection of observed qualia which can be approximately (if not entirely to completion) replicated within the confines of some computer simulated universe).

Perhaps the only people I (and perhaps every "able bodied" other) should confide in concerning personal feelings is either a mental health professional whose services I pay for or else I should not bother disclosing those personal feelings to people other than myself. (At this point in my life I do not see myself ever again needing to confide in another human being concerning my personal feelings because I have become fully integrated with my solipsistic worldview and believe that the only things an intelligent being can ever care about is what that intelligent being has knowledge and awareness of existing).

I think that mental health professionals are useful in assisting people who are deemed to be too "mentally ill" to properly maintain themselves and to offset the burden their existence incurs on human civilization at large through some kind of community service obligation (whether that service is paid or unpaid; voluntary or mandatory). I suppose what I really mean is psychiatric prisons (i.e. psychiatric hospitals). Such institutions provide an effective and relatively cheap means to prevent such "mentally ill" people from inconveniencing other people. The world outside of prison is ideally only populated with mentally well people who strive to always be of service to their community. (A person who does not always want to serve their community is not exactly mentally well and probably will need to eventually be incarcerated or disposed of so that the commmunity thrive as optimally as possible).

I do not require some other person (who could be a figment of my imagination for all I know) to acknowledge what I have to say nor to tell me compassionate, congratulatory, or didactic things about how I ought to think, feel, and behave. (I think that karbytes is "supposed to" (according to karbytes) exemplify being autonomous and extremely self-reliant (especially psychologically)). Some other people who do not have as robust of world models in their minds nor as compelling of personal goals as karbytes could genuinely benefit from professional mental health services such as counseling, medication, hospitalization, and assisted living.

(What inspired me to add this component to this note was thinking about how there are probably many more humans "in need" of professional mental health services than there are services currently being utilized to assist such people). 

While I claim to always be doing my best to be non-malicious and daresay even as compassionate and as helpful to as many humans as possible at all times, I appear to only have a finite amount of cognitive resources available at any given time along my personal space-time continuum which I solely appear to inhabit to invest in the livelihoods of any one of the humans which appear to be a part of my environment (and which I experience as non playable characters while I experience myself as the only playable character avaible (or at least the only one I am currently inhabiting (and it does seem to be the best of all options available for me personally (which is me attempting to imply that I am happy being whatever I am instead of something I am not))). Approximately 20% of all my wages from W-2 employment is taken out of my paycheck and given back to my community in the form of taxes. What I also do which may be considered charitable and useful to my community is participating in social media exchanges by publishing original (i.e. karbytes-created) content, sharing content which is not karbytes-created, and commenting or upvoting other social media users' content.
