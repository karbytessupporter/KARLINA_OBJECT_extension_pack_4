Planet Earth is ruled exclusively by the animal species which refers to itself as human.

Male humans have always been regarded as the most important and the powerful members of the human species by the human species. The female humans have been coerced into remaining childlike in size, strength, intellect, and vocation in order to be exploited by the adult male humans for sex and for birthing and looking after baby humans and prepubescent humans while the male humans have the majority of the leisure, education, and money amongst the species. The men are expected to have more mental throughput and more worldly subject matter to think about than are the women according to the human species as a whole (and the women and girls are coerced into keeping their thoughts limited to what makes those women and girls useful to the men and boys which rule over those women and girls and which permit those women and girls to be allowed to have even the most basic necessities and to avoid being more brutally tortured and neglected).

Human civilization has always been and always will be fundamentally governed by <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_03_december_2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Darwinian Natural Selection</a> (because such natural law governs how all things evolve and decay in this universe at every level of physical reality (at least within this universe)). Therefore, there will always be an imminent threat of violent interactions between humans occurring as a result of ongoing territorial disputes and greed amidst scarce resources. Tribe A always wants to survive at the expense of Tribe B (and vice versa). Because war is likely to break out at any time throughout human civilization, humans should be equipped with weapons and militaries and be ready to defend themselves against competitor humans which threaten to crowd them out of an existence worth living for.

I see that transgenderism is little more than intensive role play (specifically the role play of a human individual adopting sufficiently many traits of its opposite biological sex in order to be treated by humans in general as a member of that opposite sex instead of as a member of that person's birth sex). Only hermaphroditic humans have unintentional and innate gender ambiguity (often to the extent that such people are infertile (i.e. unable to sexually reproduce (which means that hermaphroditism in humans is a "maladaptive" genetic mutation which is socially classified as having some kind of rare disease which is responsible for preventing more of such humans from having that particular disease))). I decided to leave my legal name and legal gender the same as it was when it was assigned to me by human medical, legal, and custodial authorities at approximately the time I was born while committing myself to a lifelong regimen of injecting my body with testosterone such that I, more or less, have approximately as much testosterone in my body as a man my age would likely have for the purpose of acquiring and retaining the benefits associated with having that level of testosterone such as increased upper body strength, increased bone density, increased stamina, increased willingness to fight and to take dangerous risks, and to not appear to be a target of sexual harassment, rape, and other forms of violence which men have traditionally inflicted on women while knowing those women were not likely able to defend themselves without having able-bodied comrades close by to intervene.

Without going into detail, I want to propose my hypothesis that science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (though traditionally being regarded as predominantly (if not exclusively) male domains of interest and expertise) education and career advancement makes gender, race, and age almost completely irrelevant within the context of a relatively new, egalitarian, and meritocratic socioeconomic and cultural landscape. By contrast, less intellectually rigorous domains of expertise tend to pit different races, genders, and ages of humans against each other in a more warlike and "scarcity driven" context. I see the girls and women in such intellectually impoverished contexts behaving like prostitutes who can hardly do anything without a companion by her side while always needing someone other than her telling her what to do (while she appears to literally have no interests nor expertise outside of sustenance-level existence and while appearing to be intellectually and psychologically stunted at the level of a teenage girl who is not able nor allowed to live without a male guardian or male spouse). In "the ghetto", the income gap is wider between men and women than it is in more "white collar professional" contexts (especially in the information technology sector due to the information technology sector having one of the flattest leadership hierarchies if not the flattest). 
In case this is not obvious to the public, I (karbytes) am trying to stealthily (but not too stealthily) get into a full-time technology sector job within the next five years after I pad my resume with more relevant job related experience, personal projects (especially software engineering examples), and a deeper understanding of how everything works overall.

<span style="background:#00ff00">I do not mean to enforce harmful limiting beliefs about the human species nor of specific human individuals, but I do think it is in humanity's best interest for me to be honest about how I feel and what I believe.</span>

Although I identify as a <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_10_december_2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hard determinist</a> (i.e. someone who thinks free will is merely an illusion and that all events occur as a result of immutable algorithmic processes which force those events to unfold in exactly one chronological, spatial, and energetic permutation instead of in any alternative configuration), I do think that, virtually speaking, "blue collar" males generally have more "free will" than do "blue collar" females and that <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-collar_worker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"white collar"</a> people generally have more "free will" than do <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue-collar_worker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"blue collar"</a> people. That is because "blue collar" people are relegated to more primitive and less cerebral and less modern positions of labor, leisure, and life in general. "Blue collar" people (according to my observations) tend to be more patriarchal, more indifferent to environmental sustainability issues, more vain, more aggressive, more jealousy-driven, more sex-driven, and less autonomous, less introverted, less polite, and less genuinely ingenious than their "white collar" counterparts.

In many respects I feel like a hostage who was originally set up to be a "white collar" person but ended up making decisions which landed me in predominantly "blue collar" spaces where I feel like the only member of my kind fighting to keep even a part-time job and whatever else I have managed to retain of my formerly and aspirationally "white collar" existence while more brutish, tribalistic, and chauvinistic "blue collar" people try to discourage me from having a better lifestyle than them. That's why I feel the need to wear a mask even though the COVID-19 pandemic is mostly over while I am in the vicinity of those caustic caterwauling apes I call "the face police" (because they are very aggressive about making superficial appearance all I am allowed to care about (which makes it easier for them to overlook the "white collar" attributes I have which they either covet or else despise) and, also, to hardly say a word unless it is to keep the peace and to get paid.

Apparently, I'm supposed to make friends and family who I regularly physically hang out with the center of my life's meaning instead of making my hobbies and creative, academic, recreational, or spiritual endeavors the primary source of my life's intrinsic meaning. Otherwise, I'm being too egotistical and deserve to have some of my property, money, or health stolen (in order to "level the playing field" in a communist and culturally conformist manner). Also, I'm not supposed to sleep outside of some housing unit where people who know me keep track of my whereabouts and status on a daily basis.

Like I've said in past blog posts, I want to advise readers of my blog posts to not take those blog posts "too seriously" and to see those blog posts as mostly hyperbolic rather than literal and historically accurate records of human history. There might be trace amounts of historical accuracy in the blog posts I write, but most of that content is what I consider to be merely imaginary scenarios for the purpose of my mind gaining a deeper understanding of what goes on inside it and how it works.

Like other pieces of information, something as nebulous as my mind is not literally the physical substrate which enables it to exist (as a virtual reality on top of (relative) physical reality). Hence, even if every cell in my body is replaced with a new cell while the essential structure those cells collectively exhibit is retained, the structure (which is a substrate-neutral pattern comprised purely of information) has the potential to be preserved for an indefinitely long time period. These blog post are relatively simple patterns of digital information which represent parts of my mind or, at the very least, are fossils which reveal the unique nature of my mind in particular.

(I think that using "big words" around "blue collar" people makes those "blue collar" people angry. I hear them protesting at me most vehemently when I am writing content for my personal websites or when I am thinking about what to write in my persistent websites. Also, such people seem to think I should be forced to not be allowed to use humor, poise, and ingenuity in the face of personal adversity because that would be akin to me "showing off" my vulgar affluence instead of being overtly emotionally upset and lacking in coping skills as those people seem to prefer I be. I have only recently started to conclude that the best way for me to avoid unemployment and brutality amidst such people is to implicitly act as though only "blue collar" men and boys matter while everyone else is here solely for their benefit. Let the thugs be as loud, belligerent, pollution-generating, and attention-seeking as they want or else you disrupt the patriarchal status quo and risk getting penalized in ways you want to avoid. Understand that they deserve good things in life more than you do because they (unlike you) have more friends in the area than you ever will (because those people prevent you from interfacing with members of your own kind (i.e. people who share your "white collar" interests and aspirations and sensibilities)).

Remember, "white collar" is the enemy of "blue collar" while "blue collar" is the only protagonist. The "blue collar" should steal from and exploit the "white collar" in the name of justice. Only the "white collar" can be held accountable for their actions. "Blue collar" people are in too much (chronic) pain to exhibit self control and consideration for people other than whoever is part of their close-knit cliques.

If I think some unflattering thought about you, that's a crime. If you punch me in the face for uttering some unflattering comment about you, you are the innocent victim and I am the evil perpetrator of violence in that situation. I hold myself to a higher standard of conduct and intellect than what I hold most others of my species to.

There! It's time to go.

If it was not for the fact that my parents give me money, a place to live, and a vehicle, I would probably not talk to them more than once per year for the rest of my life. 

I suspect that my father is opposed to me thriving as a white collar professional and having the kind of lifestyle I think is most ideal because he passive aggressively smokes cigarettes in the house and acts like he has nothing to do all day everyday but wait to be noticed while demanding that I be ready to smile and greet him while he seems to know I want solitude and breathing space very badly. I get the sense that he and many "blue collar" people rejoice in this borderline "rape apologist" chauvinist patriarchal social norm which enforces that everyone remain in a permanently downtrodden and intellectually deprived (and health deprived) condition.

(I felt the need to include this excerpt from a private note which I wrote earlier today after I thought that perhaps I would have a "white collar" job and my own apartment by now if it were not for my parents discouraging me from studying and using my room at either one of their houses because that's me trying to have too good of a lifestyle compared to what they want me to have. My father seems to prefer I remain underemployed and deprived of personal space more than just about anyone I know. My father seems like a typical "blue collar" person despite having been unemployed for over three decades. He seems to think that I should not be allowed to ignore him if he wants attention to the extent that he and others have seemingly conspired to make where I legally live inhospitable to me so that I do not get any real advantage of living there (other than a hard-won shower once in a while in exchange for being subtly sexually harassed and exposed to noxious amounts of secondhand cigarette smoke) while the baby boomers who frequent the place are the only ones seemingly allowed to have fun there or even to be able to control their sleep schedules. I think most people would accuse me of lying and of accusing my parents of malicious intent while my parents are, in reality, not intentionally trying to sabotage me. Well, if I'm not useful to my parents and not useful to anyone else who seems to matter (i.e. a son, a boyfriend, a legal authority), I might not be considered important enough for people other than myself to take interest in. Hence, if I am made to disappear, seemingly no one would notice nor care. In fact, I think some people would be happy if I am gotten rid of so that I do not get in the way of their political agenda (to keep fossil fuels instated for as long as possible, to render contraception illegal, and to prevent women from being as ambitious and egotistical as men).

Okay. For real now: it's time to go! (Bye(for today at least)).

There was something I have been meaning to write for several days but did not get around to until now because I was afraid that writing or publishing that thought would cause the literal universe I live inside of to go through more chaos and suffering as a result of me articulating such "forbidden knowledge":

<span style="background:#ffff00">I think that it is very plausible that any phenomenon which is observed to occur by some information processing agent named was consciously or subconsciously desired by that particular information processing agent to occur at the actual coordinates in that information processing agent's solipsistic space-time continuum.</span>

The above paragraph describes a hypothetical <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Age" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"new age"</a> metaphysical phenomenon referred to as <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_attraction_(New_Thought)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"law of attraction"</a> (i.e. the idea that a person thinking that something should happen causes that thing to literally happen for that person). 

I was afraid the collateral damage which expressing such an idea could be the result of is <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-fulfilling_prophecy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">self-fulling prophecy</a> (i.e. the hypothetical tendency of a person to experience some event which that person does not intend to experience yet experiences as a result of that person mentally focusing on the idea of that event before that person experiences that event) which is caused by goal-oriented actions influenced by <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmation bias</a>.

<span style="background:#00ffff">I am starting to see a streamlined, stable, and very logically clear stream of information flow in my mind. It flows beneath these words.</span>
