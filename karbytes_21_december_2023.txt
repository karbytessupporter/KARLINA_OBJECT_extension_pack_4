Within the past week I lost a pair of sunglasses, a USB flash drive with details about my personal bank account in it, a USB-C to USB port cable, a high-end sleeping bag, and several nights of sleep due to being frequently harassed by other humans and corralled by them into hiding in physically uncomfortable places.

I noticed that, as soon as I start mentally preparing to delve into time-consuming and intellectually-rigorous projects which I expect to take multiple days to complete, something happens in my environment which causes me to have to abruptly pack up my belongings and leave the premises (and oftentimes that happens multiple times within the span on three hours). That's typically when I lose personal belongings.

I imagine someone like pig_gorl chortling that no one except for me wants me to complete my projects to my satisfaction (which means that my projects are not in sufficiently high demand to be allowed to be worked on (which means no one except for me is bothered by my projects not getting complete to my satisfaction (which means no one except for me is willing to supply the labor and material inputs needed to complete those projects to my satisfaction))).

For approximately one decade I have strongly felt that computer programming is one of the most cost-effective, safe, accessible, and effective disciplines which almost any human could relatively cheaply do routinely in order to increase and maintain cognitive capacities and to exert some creative control over what I presume is a fundamentally computational universe. Throughout the ten years I have been a computer science student and blogger I expected other people to appreciate how inclusive of all human demographics I was trying to be and to, like me, develop a lifelong and passionate love affair with software development and computer science and information technology in general (especially for philosophical reasons). I admit that I am still in some degree of shock how unreceptive the general public has been towards my web presence and agenda as karbytes.

Perhaps my evangelism about promoting computer science as an accessible, inclusive, and empowering hobby is seen by many people as being incompatible with their priorities and interests. Perhaps such people think my web presence and zeal towards such is excessively arrogant, expensive, and countercultural (and what such people think I should do instead is make interpersonal "in person" (rather than predominantly online) relationships with family and friends the only context in which I communicate, relax, and work in order to support my community and to extend my legitimate membership within that community (which without I would be practically naked on the streets begging for bare minimum necessities for my individual survival).

I figure there is not much time for me to recover from adversities which I typically experience multiple of daily. It seems that some other people are seriously trying to force me to waste my time, money, and energy to the extent that I am rendered too depleted and in pain to complete the aforementioned projects or even to simply do more than sleep (or writhe in agony) my life away. Apparently there are some humans who think that I was not incarcerated for a long enough prison sentence for past crimes I have committed (and one of those crimes consisted of me throwing a metal spoon at the back of someone's head during a heated argument which I do not remember was about nor how it started (though the victim was not obviously injured (though if that person shows any signs of brain damage I expect to be blamed for it (which is why some people seem to think that I deserve to suffer some form of retaliatory brain damage)))). Some people seem to think I deserve to be forced to procrastinate as punishment for procrastinating. What I think is going on is that people do not want me showing off my affluence in any way given that I do not currently earn enough money to be legitimately affluent. (Such people seem to think people are only allowed to be affluent through inheriting money from wealthy family members or by being invited into elitist societies by elites (and I think some
people are trying to keep me from having opportunities to become acquainted with such elites)).

I can imagine pig_gorl saying that the world is already over populated with plenty of science and technology experts to take my place in such roles (and that my advancing my technical knowledge and skills is not what society needs and that such a thing is purely egotistical self promotion on my part which the world does not want to allow). "You're too old and already had plenty of chances to get a white collar science/technology job. It's time for you to get out of the way and let fresh college graduates take those jobs and educational opportunities instead of you. You are only allowed to stay in poverty and in too much turmoil to get anything other than bare minimum survival done."

This note almost seems too petty for me to want to share with the general public (but I probably will). I have had a relatively easy time tonight hanging out away from residential and from public commercial locations. I did not sleep last night and put a lot of pressure on myself to get some code files uploaded to a public GitHub repository but I really see no legitimate need to rush to get that done tonight. 

I genuinely enjoy making my code modular, succinct, well documented, and beautiful in terms of its timeless logic. The application I strongly anticipate building next (and taking me up to three months to complete) is a single web page application (written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) which graphs functions (in the format y = f(x)) onto a two-dimensional Cartesian grid and which divides an interval along the x-axis into some natural number of equally-sized subintervals and which attempts to visually depict a process of computing the area of the region bound by the function, the interval endpoints (i.e. x = a and y = b where a is smaller than b and where a and b are real number constants), and the x-axis by drawing rectangles whose bases are the aforementioned subinterval lengths and whose heights are where y = f(x) and the left endpoint, the right endpoint, or the middle point of each subinterval intersect. Such a concept (which is meant to help introduce the calculus concept of integrals) is referred to as Reimann Sums. 

The closest thing to a prototype which I currently have to segue into completing my Reimann Sums application is my Triangle Graphing application (which features a minimalist Cartesian grid onto which specific triangles are graphed). Unlike that older application, I intend for the new application to show grid lines, some grid line numbers, axis labels, and function label.

The aforementioned "prototype" application is featured on the tutorial web page at the following uniform resource locator:
