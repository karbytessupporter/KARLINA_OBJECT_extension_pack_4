According to karbytes, all frames of reference are unconditionally solipsistic.

In other words, karbytes claims that the only knowledge which can ever be verified to exist is one's own memories, sensory perceptions, and relatively abstract thoughts which are derived from those relatively concrete memories and perceptions. 

(Hence, according to karbytes, the only frame of reference which karbytes seems to have direct access to (as a first-person perspective inhabiting that frame of reference (and essentially constituting that frame of reference) is karbytes' worldview (which is a somewhat organized and particular collection of raw sensory data (which karbytes perceives directly as qualia) and all data which karbytes has stored in its memory apparatus (which is a piece of hardware combined with software)))).

As a corollary to karbytes' claim that all knowledge is fundamentally solipsistic according to any frame of reference which beholds that knowledge, karbytes also claims that extrinsic value is fundamentally intrinsic value and that altruism is fundamentally egoism.

(To be clear, karbytes defines solipsism to be an immutable and essential feature of all subjective experience (and that feature is the inability to determine whether any phenomena beyond what is subjectively observed or remembered or thought about by some information processing agent exists)).

karbytes defines value to be some arbitrary metric of importance, X, assigned to a particular conceptualized phenomenon, Y, (according to some information processing agent, Z).

According to Z, X is intrinsic if Y is directly beneficial to Z in the context of Z attempting to attain its own goals without having to "purchase" such goal attainment opportunity from what Z experiences as peer or competitor information processing agents which act as "gate keepers" to the value represented by X.

According to Z, X is extrinsic if Y is indirectly beneficial to Z in the context of Z attempting to attain its own goals while having to "purchase" such goal attainment opportunity from what Z experiences as peer or competitor information processing agents which act as "gate keepers" to the value represented by X.

For example, Z might experience intrinsic value as a result of finding a wild orange tree in the forest with ripe and tasty oranges growing on it which Z harvests for its own consumption exclusively.

By contrast, Z might experience extrinsic value as a result of being paid money in exchange for helping a neighbor build a retaining wall out of bricks in that neighbor's backyard. Z does not personally benefit from that wall's construction but Z does personally benefit from the money which that neighbor paid Z as a reward for building that wall (and Z can use that money to buy itself some fresh picked oranges from the neighborhood grocery store).

According to karbytes, many people (but not karbytes) defines altruism to be sacrificing one's own attainment of intrinsic value in order to facilitate intrinsic value attainment by people other than oneself. A concrete example of that notion of altruism (i.e. self sacrifice) is Z jumping in front of a child in order to block that child from getting hit by an incoming bullet (which means that the child is saved from getting physically harmed by that bullet because Z is getting physically harmed by that bullet instead).

According to karbytes, altruism is the generation of intrinsic value by Z which increases the intrinsic value experienced by information processing agents other than Z. 

By contrast, egotism (according to karbytes) is simply the generation of intrinsic value by Z (which suggests that altruism (according to karbytes) is collective and collaborative egotism between multiple information processing agents.
