My wish is for all humans (and sentient information processing agents which are continuations of individual human attention spans (i.e. minds)) to be given the technological ability to use brain-to-computer interfacing devices to quickly render the user of the device unconscious (for periods of time lasting as long as the user's subconscious and conscious both decide are preferable (with also the option to never again wake up (i.e. go brain dead and die (hopefully) painlessly until and unless "resurected" by medical intervention))).

I remember having a conversation with Spencer approimately ten years ago about whether or not there exist any situations in which Spencer would want to die instead of live through such circumstances. Spencer said that he would always choose to live instead of die and explained his reasoning in terms which I consider to be very "rationally optiministic" (as opposed to fatalistic, pessimistic, and suicidal). I told him that I would prefer to die quickly and painlessly as possible to avoid situations which I think are "sufficiently bad" in terms of the torment I would suffer while alive inside of.

Today I spent the entire past 15 hours in the Warm Spring Baylands area of Fremont within a mile radius of where I work at the Amazon FLEX warehouse (and I took a picture of that facility today and uploaded it to the public karbytes-created GitHub repository which contains this plain-text note file).

Here are the URLs (uniform resource locators) for each of the images I took today while working on my laptop outside today (after spending approimately one hour working on my website at the only Starbucks which was open in the area):
