Approximately one week ago I was thinking that perhaps nature (as a whole) is not sentient even though at least one partition of nature which is smaller than the whole of nature appears (to at least itself) to have sentience. 

<span style="background:#ffff00">(I define sentience as the ability of an object to generate a virtual universe which is rendered and traversed through by exactly one spatially finite <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">information processing agent</a> in the form of exactly one space-time continuum in which specific qualia appear and disappear in exactly one chronological order).</span>

(I define <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nature</a> as the set of all observed qualia (i.e. phenomena) and of all imaginary or else unobserved qualia (i.e. noumena)).

<span style="background:#00ff00">Today I thought that (a) individual <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cells</a> in the human body might not have sentience as I described and that (b) groups of multiple humans might also lack sentience (because both of those categories of matter lack their own central nervous systems (i.e. <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_brain" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brains</a>) which are as complex as those of individual humans).</span>

As an apparent user of exactly one human brain, karbytes (currently) thinks that karbytes' own consciousness is probably an emergent property of sufficiently many brain cells arranged in exactly one particular material and evolutionary configuration rather than a fundamental ubiquitous property throughout all of nature.
