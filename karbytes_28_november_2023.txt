Between 12AM and 1AM (after karbytes burned the three M_DISCs mentioned in the plain-text file named karbytes_27_november_2023.txt in the public karbytes-created GitHub repository named KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_4 (and while karbytes was transporting its equipment via van from Don Biddle Community Park in Dublin (California) to karbytes' legal residence in Castro Valley (California))), karbytes concluded that the black zipper locking case containing those M_DISCs was stolen by the police or possibly by civilians (because karbytes thoroughly checked the locations where the case of M_DISCs were assumed (by karbytes) to be likely by karbytes to be found). 

(Today's unexplained disappearance of karbytes' physical property is one of multiple of such incidents to have occurred during the past five years (and one of those incidents involved karbytes apparently being stealthily and briefly rendered unconscious, amnesiac, and/or under the influence of hypnotic suggestion while in the presence of a police officer at Ohlone College after karbytes was found attempting to spend the night on the floor of one of the campus bathrooms (and what specifically went missing was karbytes' entire wallet full of debit and identification cards))).

What is particularly troublesome to karbytes about the latest confiscation of karbytes' physical property is the fact that each of those discs contained debit card numbers, expiration dates, and security codes in addition to other financial and legal data which may enable people other than karbytes to access karbytes' money and to possibly impersonate karbytes. 

(karbytes decided to assume that the police confiscated those M_DISCs and that the police will not use the data on those discs to seriously disenfranchise karbytes).

karbytes placed an order for a new set of three M_DISCs via Amazon dot Com, but unlike karbytes' previous M_DISC order, karbytes opted to have the package delivered to karbytes' legal residence instead of to the most conveniently located Amazon locker due to the fact that the locker was said to be full.

In an attempt to console itself about the theft and resulting loss of money, time, and physical, mental, and emotion labor involved in burning those discs only to have them get stolen, karbytes reminded itself that the M_DISCs which were stolen today each contained an out of date zip file of KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_3. The new M_DISC set which karbytes intends to burn before the end of the year will contain the most up to date version of that repository.
