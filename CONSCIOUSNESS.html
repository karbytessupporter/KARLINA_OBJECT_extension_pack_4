<p>Approximately one week ago I was thinking that perhaps nature (as a whole) is not sentient even though at least one partition of nature which is smaller than the whole of nature appears (to at least itself) to have sentience. </p>
<p><u>(I define sentience as the ability of an object to generate a virtual universe which is rendered and traversed through by exactly one spatially finite <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">information processing agent</a> in the form of exactly one space-time continuum in which specific qualia appear and disappear in exactly one chronological order).</u></p>
<p>(I define <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nature</a> as the set of all observed qualia (i.e. phenomena) and of all imaginary or else unobserved qualia (i.e. noumena)).</p>
<p><u>Today I thought that (a) individual <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cells</a> in the human body might not have sentience as I described and that (b) groups of multiple humans might also lack sentience (because both of those categories of matter lack their own central nervous systems (i.e. <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_brain" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brains</a>) which are as complex as those of individual humans).</u></p>
<p>As an apparent user of exactly one human brain, karbytes (currently) thinks that karbytes&#8217; own consciousness is probably an emergent property of sufficiently many brain cells arranged in exactly one particular material and evolutionary configuration rather than a fundamental ubiquitous property throughout all of nature.</p>
