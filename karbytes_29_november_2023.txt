Two things which bother me profoundly about humans (as a human) is the dangerously large amounts of toxic chemicals (a) in the form of petroleum combustion fumes and (b) in the form of cigarette smoke. 

I have been attempting to commute by bicycle for most of my commutes around the San Francisco Bay Area (in conjunction with BART) and reserve driving the petroleum combustion car I have been borrowing from my parents for as few trips as necessary (to achieve my goals (as karbytes and for karbytes exclusively)). Right now that car is parked in the parking lot directly outside the Amazon Hub facility I work at (usually five days per week for approximately three hours per day starting at 9AM)). I doubt anything bad is going to happen if I do as I describe in this paragraph.

One thing which I think may inspire the general United States population (of humans) to take more interest in ecology of Earth's biosphere and how human activity impacts it is the widespread announcement that men in the most recent generations have lower testosterone levels (on average) than the men in older generations due (at least in part) to the fact that there is more estrogen molecules in the water supply than ever before due primarily to hormonal birth control methods (which prevent eggs from being released from the ovaries by chemically tricking the body into thinking it is already pregnant).

Starting late in the year 2015 (and continuing to this day (i.e. 29_NOVEMBER_2023)), I have been using a non hormonal intrauterine device as (allegedly 99.9% birth control method) basically to prevent a zygote (i.e. an egg fertilized by a sperm) from attaching to the wall of my uterus (which I suppose is essentially a form of early term abortion).

Starting late in the year 2022 (and continuing to this day), I have been using intramuscular injections of testosterone (which has masculinized my appearance and caused my ovaries to stop releasing eggs (which would naturally occur approximately once per month until menopause)). Hence, I am using two highly effective methods of birth control (i.e. anticontraception) simultaneously.
